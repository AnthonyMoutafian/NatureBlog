            An earthquake (also known as a quake, tremor or temblor)<br/> 
            is the shaking of the surface of the Earth resulting from<br/>
            a sudden release of energy in the Earth's lithosphere that<br/>
            creates seismic waves. Earthquakes can range in intensity,<br/>
            from those that are so weak that they cannot be felt, to<br/>
            those violent enough to propel objects and people into <br/>
            the air, damage critical infrastructure, and wreak <br/>
            destruction across entire cities. The seismic activity of <br/>
            an area is the frequency, type, and size of earthquakes<br/> 
            experienced over a particular time. The seismicity at a <br/>
            particular location in the Earth is the average rate of <br/>
            seismic energy release per unit volume. The word tremor<br/> 
            is also used for non-earthquake seismic rumbling.
